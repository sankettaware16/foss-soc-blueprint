# How I Help Organizations Build a FOSS SOC

I help organizations design and deploy cost-effective Security Operations Centers
using open-source security tools.

## Engagement Approach

1. Requirement & risk assessment
2. SOC architecture design
3. Tool selection
4. Deployment & hardening
5. Detection use-case creation
6. Documentation and knowledge transfer

## What Organizations Gain

- Clear SOC architecture
- Open-source security tooling
- Custom detections
- Operational guidance
- No vendor lock-in

This repository documents the same approach I follow during engagements.
